## Media conversion

- First playback waits for encoders 2026-10-04
  - Start the app and, before anything else, open a file that needs converting.
  - The first playback request waits for the server to discover which video encoders work, up to five seconds on a machine where the hardware encoder test is slow (under half a second on a recent Mac). The player should show that it is preparing the file rather than appear stuck, or discovery should finish before the first file can be opened.
- HDR video converts washed out 2026-10-04
  - Open an HDR (10-bit, BT.2020) video that needs converting.
  - It is transcoded to 8-bit H.264 without tone mapping and looks washed out. Converted HDR video should be tone-mapped to look like the original.
